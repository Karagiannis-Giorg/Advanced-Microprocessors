# Advanced-Microprocessors Lab
The purpose of this Lab is to familiarize ourselves with  Microchip Studio by implementing specific tasks. The tasks we were asked to implement are the following:
# Exercise-1: Simulation of an intersection consisting of a main road and a vertical railway

The purpose of this laboratory Exercise is to simulate the operation of a highway intersection, which consists of a major road and a vertical railway. On the main road there is a traffic light for cars and a traffic light for pedestrians, which lights up only after pressing a button.

# Exercise-2: Robotic vacuum cleaner simulation

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to simulate the operation of a smart home device that moves in the space of an empty room. It starts from a corner of the room and its purpose is to draw its outline.

# Exercise-3: Fan Simulation

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to simulate the motion of a fan. A fan consists of two rotary movements, a circular movement of the blades and a circular movement of the base, so that the fan can rotate and cover more space, as shown in the figure above.

# Exercise-4: Smart Greenhouse

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to simulate the operation of a smart greenhouse. Our goal here is to calculate the humidity inside of a greenhouse, if the humidity is lower from the threshold that we have set then we can press the button for watering the plants, if the humidity is higher from the threshold that we have set then we can press the button in order to enable the ventilation system.
